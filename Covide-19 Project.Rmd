# Covid-19 Worldwide Analysis as of Mid-March 2020 - Xiaomin Yang
```{r}
library("readr") 
library("ggplot2") 
library("dplyr") 
# Read datasets/confirmed_cases_worldwide.csv into confirmed_cases_worldwide
confirmed_cases_worldwide <- read_csv("/Users/reneeyang/Desktop/datasets/confirmed_cases_worldwide.csv")
```

# Confirmed cases throughout the world
```{r}
# Draw a line plot of cumulative cases vs. date
ggplot(confirmed_cases_worldwide, aes(date, cum_cases)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("Cumulative confirmed cases")
```
# China compared to the rest of the world
```{r}
confirmed_cases_china_vs_world <- read_csv("/Users/reneeyang/Desktop/datasets/confirmed_cases_china_vs_world.csv")

# See the result
glimpse(confirmed_cases_china_vs_world)

# Draw a line plot of cumulative cases vs. date, grouped and colored by is_china
# Define aesthetics within the line geom
plt_cum_confirmed_cases_china_vs_world <- ggplot(confirmed_cases_china_vs_world) +
  geom_line(aes(date, cum_cases, group=is_china, color= is_china)) +
  ylab("Cumulative confirmed cases")

who_events <- tribble(

  "2020-01-30", "Global health\nemergency declared",
  "2020-03-11", "Pandemic\ndeclared",
  "2020-02-13", "China reporting\nchange"
) %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))

# Using who_events, add vertical dashed lines with an xintercept at date
# and text at date, labeled by event, and at 100000 on the y-axis
plt_cum_confirmed_cases_china_vs_world +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=date), data=who_events,linetype= "dashed") +
  geom_text(aes(x=date,label=event), data=who_events, y=1e5)

```
In February, the majority of cases were in China. That changed in March when it really became a global outbreak: around March 14, the total number of cases outside China overtook the cases inside China. 

# Covid-19 trend line of China
```{r}
# Filter for China, from Feb 15
china_after_feb15 <- confirmed_cases_china_vs_world %>%
filter(is_china== "China", date >= "2020-02-15") 

# Using china_after_feb15, draw a line plot cum_cases vs. date
# Add a smooth trend line using linear regression, no error bars
ggplot(china_after_feb15, aes(date, cum_cases))  +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se= FALSE) +
  ylab("Cumulative confirmed cases")
```
There is a clear surge of cases around February 13, 2020, with the reporting change in China. However, a couple of days after, the growth of cases in China slows down.The growth rate in China is slower than linear.

# Covid-19 trend line of the rest of the world
```{r}
# Filter confirmed_cases_china_vs_world for not China
not_china <- confirmed_cases_china_vs_world %>%
  filter(is_china == "Not China")
# Using not_china, draw a line plot cum_cases vs. date
# Add a smooth trend line using linear regression, no error bars
plt_not_china_trend_lin <- ggplot(not_china, aes(date, cum_cases)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method= "lm", se= FALSE) +
  ylab("Cumulative confirmed cases")

# See the result
plt_not_china_trend_lin 
```
A straight line does not fit well at all, and the rest of the world is growing much faster than linearly. Next I added a logarithmic scale to the y-axis.

# Adding a logarithmic scale
```{r}
# Modify the plot to use a logarithmic scale on the y-axis
plt_not_china_trend_lin + 
  scale_y_log10()
```
In this way, I got a much closer fit to the data.

#Which countries outside of China have been hit hardest
```{r}
# Run this to get the data for each country
confirmed_cases_by_country <- read_csv("/Users/reneeyang/Desktop/datasets/confirmed_cases_by_country.csv")
glimpse(confirmed_cases_by_country)

# Group by country, summarize to calculate total cases, find the top 7
top_countries_by_total_cases <- confirmed_cases_by_country %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(total_cases = max(cum_cases)) %>%
  top_n(7, total_cases)

# See the result
top_countries_by_total_cases
```

# Plotting hardest hit countries as of Mid-March 2020
```{r}
# Get the data for the top 7 countries
confirmed_cases_top7_outside_china <- read_csv("/Users/reneeyang/Desktop/datasets/confirmed_cases_top7_outside_china.csv")

# See the result
glimpse(confirmed_cases_top7_outside_china)

# Using confirmed_cases_top7_outside_china, draw a line plot of
# cum_cases vs. date, grouped and colored by country
ggplot(confirmed_cases_top7_outside_china, aes(date, cum_cases, group=country, color=country))+
geom_line()+
ylab("Cumulative confirmed cases")
```
